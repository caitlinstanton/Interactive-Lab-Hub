Functional check-off - May 10
 
Final Project Presentations (video watch party) - May 12
 
## Objective
The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing. 
 
## Deliverables
1. Documentation of design process
2. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
3. Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)
4. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)
 
 
## Teams
You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.
 
## Examples

This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
 
 
 
# AMIDST US: Spaceship Task Simulator
By Priya Kattappurath, Caitlin Stanton, and Grace Tan
 
> ## Documentation of Design Process
> ### Motivation + Design Process
> Inspired by the game *Among Us*, we wanted to create a real-life task simulator. Originally, we wanted to do a full recreation of *Among Us*, complete with multiplayer functionality and imposters, but with the time and hardware available to us, we decided to focus on the crewmate task portion of the game. At this point, we went through all the tasks in the game and brainstormed how each of them could be implemented with our available hardware components. Then, with our time constraint in mind, we chose our favorites to be implemented, which we will elaborate on more in the following sections.
>
> ### High-Level Task Overview
> #### Wires
> In this task, wires are connected in a color-defined configuration in order to light up the respective LEDs. This is inspired by the “Fix Wiring” task in *Among Us*, which is essentially the same thing.
>
> ![wires](images/among_us_wire.png)
> #### Card Swipe
> In this task, the player swipes a conductive-fabric-wrapped card along a capacitive touch sensor for a certain amount of time to mimic the “Swipe Card” task. SImilar to the original task, if the user swipes too quickly or too slowly, they will need to repeat the task.
>
> ![swipe](images/IMG_5947.PNG)
> #### Keypad Pattern
> Inspired by the “Start Reactor” task, this consists of several buttons that will blink in a pattern that the player mimics. The pattern appends in length at each stage until they reach the final pattern.
>
> ![startreactor](images/IMG_5948.PNG)
>
> ### Honorable Mentions for Tasks
> Here are more tasks that we had come up with during our brainstorming process. While these would have been fun to include, we kept our time constraint in mind, and also noted that these tasks were not as similar to the original tasks as the ones we ultimately chose. 
> #### Engine Alignment 
> The user would move the potentiometer until it reached a certain measurement. Inspired by the “Align Engine Output” task, which requires the player to line up a dial with a line on the screen.
>
> ![alignengineoutput](images/Screenshot_20210425-144442.png)
> #### Clear out the Dumpster
> In this task, which is inspired by ”Empty Garbage”, the player would hold down the joystick (acting as the trash shoot lever), for a number of seconds.
>
> ![trash](images/Screenshot_20210425-151907.png)
> #### “Medical” Scan
> inspired by the “Submit Scan” task, would consist of the game asking the player to hold up a certain amount of fingers, and using the camera to scan and check if the correct number of fingers are held up. This is not very similar to the original task, which requires no interaction from the player.
>

>
>
> ## Archive of Code, Design Process, etc. for Final Design 
> In this section we will go over how the overall system is set up to make the game playable, and how the hardware and software components are set up for each individual task.
>
> ### Overall System and Display
> #### Hardware
> Below is an overview of the hardware for this system, which we will elaborate upon in more detail in the task specific sections.
>
> ![Hardware Block Diagram](images/SystemBlockDiagram.png)
>
>  We wanted all the hardware components to fit in a compact, easy to transport game box. We imagine this can be brought to be played in the car, on the bus, on a plane, or anywhere people are waiting.  Thus, everything needed to interact with the game can be mounted in the frame of the box, and the lid provides additional minimalist free space. We found a box that fit all the components comfortably without too much excess space.  This size was perfect since it is smaller than the average laptop, which is good for portability.  The Raspberry Pi that is exposed has no use for the game so for aesthetics, we covered it with a sign that says the name of our game.  This game box, in other words “The Skeld,” one of the locations in the *Among Us* game, is shown below.
>
> ![Game box](images/TheSkeldPicture.jpg)
>
> We also cut a hole in the game box for seamless power integration, as shown in this side view of the game. 
>
> ![kit](images/kit.jpg)
>
>Originally we wanted to make the box fully untethered by adding the file to ```bash.bashrc```, so the game would start without being connected to a laptop. The ```.bashrc``` files are located in the home directory of every Pi (specifically ```/etc```) and are run as the Pi is launching. To run the ```game.py``` script, we put the following calls at the bottom of bash.bashrc to navigate to the appropriate directory on the Pi and call our script.
>
> ![bash script](images/bash_script.png)
> 
> Unfortunately this didn’t work and threw the error message below. At first we thought the fix was calling ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` before the ```python``` command since the error message indicated a library was missing. However, upon running ```pip install``` once the Pi was turned on and logged into, all of the required libraries were installed, including the one that was reported missing in the error. Considering that perhaps the library was installed but not being seen at the right time, we added ```pip uninstall``` commands to ```bash.bashrc``` as a precaution to ensure that ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` would install the correct versions of all libraries, but this also proved unsuccessful.
>
> ![bash error](images/bash_import_error.png)
>
> Despite the ```bash.bashrc``` file not running ```game.py```, calling it manually from a terminal ran our game perfectly. This prompted us to stop spending time on the ```bash.bashrc``` file in lieu of focusing on the game itself. However, adding this functionality would be a future task that would make using the game a smoother experience.

> #### Software ([code](https://github.com/caitlinstanton/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Final%20Project/game.py))
> 
> Our game involves multiple distinct states in order to execute different tasks and keep track of the user’s progress throughout the game. Below is a diagram of the FSM that we developed. There are seven different states, one of which is shown by the INIT arrow to ```state 0```. We implemented this FSM within ```game.py``` using conditional statements based on different values of the ```state``` variable within a ```while True``` loop. This is encased in a ```try except``` block to catch any errors. This was especially useful for the I/O errors that pop up due to the unreliable nature of QWIIC connections to the buttons and capacitive touch sensor.
> 
> ![Software FSM](images/GameFSM.JPG)
> 
> The system starts at ```state -1``` as it waits for the TFT button to be pressed, the action that starts the game. It initializes the QWIIC button mapping to all six unique I2C addresses and all of the global variables needed for each task and each state transition. While doing all of this, it’s also drawing to the TFT to let the user know which TFT button starts the game.
>
> Once the start button is clicked, the FSM moves to ```state 0```. The start and end times are registered in variables with the end time being 60 seconds from the starting time. This means that the user has 60 seconds to complete all allotted tasks. In order to add an element of spontaneity to the game, the order in which the user must complete their tasks is randomized within the array ```order```. ```order``` holds 3 distinct numbers (1, 2, and 3), each corresponding to a task: 1 is wires, 2 is keypad, and 3 is card swipe. The 0th element of ```order``` is the first task, the 1st element is the second task, and the 2nd element is the third and final task. As the FSM progresses between these three states, the next state is the new 0th element of ```order``` and the previous state is removed from the array. This means that when the user has reached their final task, ```order``` will be an empty array. Some display strings for the TFT are initialized based on the elements of ```order```, as well as the pattern of integers used for buttons in the keypad task.
>
> The next three ```states 1, 2 and 3``` are tied to specific tasks, rather than the state a user would reach after completion of one, two, or three tasks. This design choice was made in the interest of shorter code; if the latter design was chosen, all three states would need the function calls for all three tasks. Each share the same display code for the TFT (described in more detail later in this report) and the same logic to move either to the losing state (```state 5```) or the winning state (```state 4```). To move to ```state 5```, the amount of time left on the clock (notated as ```time_left``` and equal to ```end - current```) must be less than or equal to zero. The user will lose even if the task has been completed because the main drive to win is to beat the clock. To move to ```state 4```, there must be no more tasks to complete (the length of ```order``` is zero) and there is time left.
>
> The task states are described in more detail in future sections. Each is run from an imported function to keep our code modular. These functions take in parameters stored within the context of ```game.py``` as global variables and output booleans to indicate whether the task has been completed or not. In the case of ```state 1``` (wires), a while loop is used to check the ```wires``` global boolean variable since polling is needed to check all of the GPIO pins associated with the wires. For ```state 2``` (keypad) the imported function handles the recursive calls for displaying the button pattern and receiving user input, so the check on the global boolean ```keypad``` is in an if statement. ```state 3``` is similar to ```state 1``` where a while loop is used to check the variable ```cardswipe``` since the capacitive touch sensor is being polled for a swipe of a specific duration.
>
> Both ```states 4 and 5``` are relatively simple. They each display the relevant message to the TFT (“YOU WON!!!” or “YOU LOST :(“) along with the prompt “Press button to restart”. If the TFT button is pressed, the FSM moves back to ```state -1``` to start the game all over again, allowing the user to have constant fun :)

> ### Wires
> #### Hardware
> ##### Parts List
> - Breadboard
> - Wires
> - Jumper Cables
> - LEDs
> ##### Setup
> To set up this task, the three different colored LEDs are placed across the middle divider of the bread board. The negative side (shorter end) of each LED is connected to the GND line of the breadboard, which is connected to the common ground of the Raspberry Pi. The power line of the breadboard is connected to the 3.3V line. For each LED, a jumper wire is attached at one end to 3.3V power, and the other end is left detached-- in game, the player will connect this to the positive end of the respective LED to turn it on. All wires and jumper cables are color coded to the color of each LED so the player knows which jumper cable to attach to which LED. 3 additional wires connect the positive end of each LED to GPIO5, GPIO6, and GPIO13 on the Raspberry Pi. When all wires are connected (and all LEDs are on), these GPIO pins will all read HIGH, and signal that the task has been completed. 
>
>![Wires and LEDs](images/Wires.jpg)
> #### Software ([code](https://github.com/caitlinstanton/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Final%20Project/wires.py))
> As each of the wiring is connected in parallel and corresponds to its respective GPIO pin, we check whether the values are high, which means that the wire has been properly connected.  To make this easier, we created boolean variables that represent each of the colored wires: green, red, and yellow.  We also made sure to call `GPIO.cleanup()` at the end.  We initially had a bug and found out that we originally had pull up instead of pull down.  This is wrong because we wanted to read when all values are high.

> ### Card Swipe
> #### Hardware
> ##### Parts List
> - Capacitive touch sensor
> - Conductive Tape
> - 1 QWIIC Connector
> - Conductive Fabric
> - Card-sized piece of cardboard
> - Markers to decorate
> ##### Setup
> For the actual card, we used two pieces of cardboard, since only one piece of cardboard was not thick enough for the capacitive touch sensor to detect the card.  On the top side of the card, a piece of capacitive fabric is adhered (this is the side that the player will “swipe” onto the capacitive touch sensor).  This was also decorated with marker as the card in the game is decorated, as shown below.
>
> ![Card](images/PXL_20210505_162508983.jpg)
>
> In order to do a capacitive touch sensor, a strip of copper tape is taped onto the frame of the game board. This provides a flat surface to swipe the card on. One end of the copper tape is connected to a pin on the capacitive touch sensor, which is connected to the Raspberry Pi via QWIIC connector as shown below.
>
> ![Card Swipe Task](images/CardSwipe.jpg)
>
> #### Software ([code](https://github.com/caitlinstanton/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Final%20Project/cardswipe.py))
> In the *Among Us* game, players find difficulty in having to swipe the card at the right speed.  The task will not be completed if the player swipes too slowly or too quickly.  By using the capacitive touch sensor, we are able to see what the value if the card touches it or not, meaning if it's high or not respectively.  [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ikEmYBMfXzu8OYsWHdutW9wnDvSrpVLA/view?usp=sharing) is test showing how the card with a piece of conductive fabric is being sensed when placed on the capacitive tape.
>
> We decided to implement this aspect of the game into our simulator so we ensured that the task would only be completed if the card was swiped between 1 and 3 seconds.  If the card swipe was not between 1 and 3 seconds, the player will stay in the loop.
>
> Originally, the datetime library was used since that was used in an earlier lab.  However, after realizing that we only needed to keep track of time and this library made lots of unnecessary objects since it also stored the date, we decided to use `time.perf_counter()` to track the swipe time, which is done by checking the value of the capacitive touch.  The first time it is touched, that is the `start_time` and after the card is no longer touching, `time.perf_counter()` is called and stored into `end_time`.  The difference of these two variables is the amount of time the card touched the capacitive tape and the task will only be complete if that difference falls between 1 and 3 seconds.
>
> Another error we experienced was due to syntax.  Using an equals sign instead of minus sign did not throw an error but started setting variables to weird values.
>
> ### Keypad Pattern
> #### Hardware
> ##### Parts List
> - 6 LED Buttons
> - 6 QWIIC Connectors
> - Empty mochi ice cream container to mount buttons
> ##### Setup
> The 6 LED buttons are organized by alternating color for aesthetic effect. The grid of buttons are connected together using QWIIC connectors and mounted onto the frame of the game board. To connect to the Raspberry Pi, an intermediate QWIIC connector connects the button grid to the capacitive touch sensor (which is already QWIIC connected to the Raspberry Pi). The libraries needed to communicate with these QWIIC buttons are [sparkfun-qwiic-i2c](https://pypi.org/project/sparkfun-qwiic-i2c/) and [sparkfun-qwiic-buttom](https://pypi.org/project/sparkfun-qwiic-button/), both of which were installed using ```pip```.
>
> Devices have specific addresses to communicate via I2C. Since all of the buttons shared the same default address of ```0x6f```, we had to change them to be six distinct addresses. This couldn’t be done with all six buttons connected to the Pi because the commands to change the I2C address would be confused by seeing multiple devices connected using the same address. One by one, each button was connected to the Pi using a QWIIC connector. We ran ```I2C_scan.py``` from lab 2 to check the I2C address of the button (even though it was always expected to be ```0x6f``` it didn’t hurt to check!). The [Github repository for the QWIIC buttons](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Button_Py) and the [official Python documentation](https://qwiic-button-py.readthedocs.io/en/main/apiref.html) described the functions needed to change the button’s I2C address. These findings were compiled into ```change_i2c.py``` which initialized a QWIIC button object using the default I2C address and asked for user input to determine the new I2C address. In the case where one button had its address changed already, the line ```my_button = qwiic_button.QwiicButton()``` had to be changed to use that I2C address as a parameter (typecast as an integer, not a string). If the address was written as a string, the following error was thrown whenever the button object was referenced
>
> ![dictionary error](images/dict_error.png)
>
After running this script on all six buttons, the I2C addresses were: ```0x6f```, ```0x5f```, ```0x4f```, ```0x3f```, ```0x2f```, and ```0x1f```.

>
> #### Software ([code](https://github.com/caitlinstanton/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Final%20Project/keypad.py))
>
> The action for this task is to press the pattern of buttons correctly. This pattern grows in length, starting by blinking the first button, then the first two buttons, and so on until a pattern of five buttons is blinked. We used an FSM to keep track of the user’s progress for each subset pattern, as well as the entire pattern, and a diagram of it can be seen below.
>
> ![FSM for keypad](images/keypadFSM.jpg)
>
> Once the game-wide FSM from ```game.py``` has called ```press_pattern()``` from ```simon.py``` the keypad FSM goes to ```state 0```. This is where the initialization of the variables to keep track of the subset pattern the user is on (```round```) and the array of registered button presses (```presses```) occurs. 
>
> The FSM then immediately transitions to ```state 1``` where the button blinking happens. If ```round``` is equal to the length of the full pattern, then there’s no need to blink any more buttons because all rounds of the task has been completed; the FSM then moves to the done state ```state 4```. However, if there is more of the pattern to be repeated, the helper function ```blink_buttons()``` is called with the parameter ```round``` as an input. This helper function goes through the pattern of buttons (stored in ```pattern``` from the global variable in ```game.py```) and blinks the button mapped at the I2C address in the global dictionary from ```game.py``` that keeps track of which button has which I2C address. When all of the buttons of the subset pattern have been blinked, ```presses``` is set to an empty array and a local variable ```count``` is set to zero. This local variable keeps track of the user’s button press to compare to the element in ```pattern```.
>
> In ```state 2```, a for loop polls all six QWIIC buttons to see if the library function ```is_button_pressed()``` returns True. When this happens, the button value is added to ```pressed``` and the FSM transitions to ```state 3```. Otherwise the FSM will stay within ```state 2``` until a button is pressed.
>
> ```state 3``` is responsible for seeing if the currently pressed button matches the expected button in ```pattern```. If ```presses[count]``` (since ```count``` keeps track of the index of the press) is equal to ```pattern[count]``` the FSM can either continue with the current round and go to ```state 2``` or start the next round with a larger subset pattern in ```state 1```. The difference between these two state transitions is that the FSM will continue with the current round if ```count``` hasn’t reached the last index of the current round (equal to ```round - 1```), or move to the next round otherwise by incrementing ```round```. In the case of an incorrect press, the FSM moves to ```state 1``` but doesn’t change the value of ```round```; instead, the array ```presses``` is set to an empty array so the user has to start fresh with the current subset pattern.
>
> ```state 4``` is the done state. Nothing happens here, but the output of ```press_pattern()``` includes the state. Within ```game.py``` there’s a check to see if the returned ```state``` value is equal to 4, in which case ```keypad``` is set to True and the task has been completed.
>
> ### Display
> ##### Parts List
> - Mini PiTFT screen
> ##### Setup
> For the display, we decided to have a simple interface that mimics the *Among Us* game so that the background is black and the text would be white.  The first screen just indicates which button to press to start the game.  Once the button is pressed, the timer is displayed on the top in bigger font for emphasis.  Similarly to the game, we list of tasks in order.  Originally, we only had bullets, but we realized that having a numbered list would be more clear that these tasks had to be done in order since the *Among Us* game allows any order of completion for tasks.  We followed the game's convention of a green task as complete.  We made the incomplete tasks as red for emphasis.  This is shown below.
>
> ![screens1](images/Screens1.png)
>
> We also had the idea to warn the player when there are 10 seconds left in the game by having the bakcground flash yellow every other second.  We also decided that the text would be black for this because white on yellow background was rather hard to see.  This is shown below.
>
> ![screens2](images/Screens2.png)
>
> Once time is up, the game will either display that the player won if all tasks have been complete, or that the player lost if not all tasks are complete.  The player also has the option to restart, which will take the player to the initial screen.  This is shown below.
>
> ![screens3](images/Screens3.png)
>
> #### Software ([preliminary code](https://github.com/caitlinstanton/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Final%20Project/display.py) and [integrated code](https://github.com/caitlinstanton/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Final%20Project/game.py))
> We used similar code from lab 2 of this class and enabled button B as that is the button being used to start and restart the game.  We also added `sleep(.5)` for a delay to minimize debouncing.  The black background and corresponding text, colors, and locations would be displayed.  However, for the last 10 seconds of the game, which would be checked with a condition of whether time left was less than 10, we made sure to make the background yellow if it was an even value of `time.time()` so that it would blink yellow every other second.  We also made sure to change the white text to black for this.
>
> When integrating the display code with the game code, we found that it was difficult to display the order due to how we randomize the order of tasks so it was not fixed.  Thus, we would do a check for every state in the game to see which task corresponded to which order and displayed this order accordingly and it worked.

>## Video of our project (including someone using our project)
> Our final video demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/jBd_7DRzVd8).
>
>
> ## Reflections on Process
>  Overall, we had a lot of fun recreating this game in real life. We were able to explore various aspects of interactive devices in a sleek game format. If we were to remake this project in the future, we would opt for a different connection method rather than QWIIC connectors. While these connectors are “quick” for prototyping, we found that the connections were unreliable, and the I2C were constantly disconnecting. 
>
> We also found that there were multiple ways to implement the sensors for each task, and went through a lot of user testing and iterating to decide which implementation would work the best. For example, for the capacitive touch for the card swipe task, we considered using multiple capacitive touch pads, and Ilan had brought up multiple connections to different GPIO pins. However, in one of our previous labs [here](https://github.com/caitlinstanton/Interactive-Lab-Hub/tree/Spring2021/Lab%204), we found that having multiple capacitive touch pads were really finicky and the Raspberry Pi had difficulty keeping track of all of them. Thus, we opted for a single capacitive touch pad to simplify the system and ensure it will work as expected. 
>
> Additionally, we found that doing user testing was extremely important since testing out various ways to do the keypad task was helpful in determining if the buttons were blinking too quickly, the card swipe was too easy or difficult, or if the amount of time we give for the game is too much time.  Having multiple users test the system was also helpful since everyone would give feedback with how the interface was and if the directions on the screen were clear enough.
>
> Finally, we experimented with both in-person and virtual meetings. These meeting types allowed us to be flexible with our restricting schedules while we could work together on both hardware and software aspects of the project.
